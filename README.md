CoFlu is a powerful text manipulation, generation, and comparison tool. It's designed for tasks like proofreading, editing, content creation, version control, and ensuring text consistency. CoFlu offers unique capabilities, including AI-powered text generation, audio transcription, and unprecedented layout-preserving .docx translation using LLMs.

**Key Differentiator:** As of February 2025, CoFlu is the *only* website offering Microsoft Word (.docx) translation that *fully preserves the original document's layout* (fonts, styles, tables, images, and other elements) while using LLMs for superior translation quality. This sets CoFlu apart, providing a powerful and unique capability for users working with formatted documents.

## 丘뙖잺 Features

**1. Text Manipulation & Comparison:**

- **File Upload:** Supports `.epub`, `.txt`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.css`, `.xml`, `.json`, and `.docx`.
- **Text Comparison:**
	- Calculates Levenshtein distance and percentage differences.
	- Optional "semantic cleanup" for more meaningful comparisons.
	- **Diff Views:** Single-column (insertions/deletions highlighted) or double-column (side-by-side).
- **Text Transformations:**
	- Convert case (uppercase/lowercase).
	- Deduplicate and sort lines (alphabetically, including space-separated words).
	- Remove bold formatting and extra spaces.
	- Format LaTeX (spacing around delimiters) and HTML (`&nbsp;` to spaces).
	- Retab: Convert spaces to tabs for consistent indentation.
- **Markdown Rendering:**
	- Converts Markdown to HTML, including math (KaTeX or MathJax).
	- Print/save as PDF with Ctrl+P.

**2. AI-Powered Capabilities:**

- **AI Text Generation:** Uses leading AI models:
	- **OpenAI:** `gpt-4o`, `o3-mini`, and others.
	- **Anthropic:** `claude-3-7-sonnet`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `claude-3-5-haiku`.
	- **DeepSeek:** R1 and V3.
	- **Google:** Gemini 2.0 models, including video input.
	- **Groq:** LPU high-speed inference, including vision models.
	- **Lambda:** LLaMA.
	- **xAI:** The most based Grok.
	- **OpenRouter:** Unsage Dolphin 3.0, Mistral, and `gpt-4o` extended output.
	- **Perplexity:** Sonar Deep Research.
	- **Alibaba:** `qwen-max`, `qwen-vl-max`, and others.
	- **SambaNova:** Fastest full-size DeepSeek and LLaMAs.
	- **Together.AI:** Qwens.
- **Prompting:**
	- Predefined prompts (e.g., "Proofread this text").
	- Create and save custom prompts.
	- Optional streaming output (see text as it's generated).
	- Image/video input (for supported models).
- **Audio Transcription:**
	- Transcribes `.flac`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.mpeg`, `.mpga`, `.m4a`, `.ogg`, `.wav`, `.webm`.
	- Uses Whisper models.
	- Supports multiple languages.
- **Text Translation:** Translates text using the selected AI model (also as part of the .docx feature).

**3. Groundbreaking .DOCX Translation:**

- **Upload & Translate .DOCX:** Handles Microsoft Word documents.
- **Full Layout Preservation:** *Crucially*, CoFlu maintains the *exact* original formatting (fonts, styles, tables, images).
- **LLM-Powered:** Uses the selected AI model for translation.
- **Translation Settings:**
	- **Batch Size:** Number of text chunks sent to the AI at once (smaller = more stable).
	- **Batch RPM:** Delay between batches (same as API rate limits).
	- **Exponential Retry:** Number of retries for failed API requests.
- **Download Translated .DOCX:** Automatically downloads the translated document.

**4. User Experience:**

- **Local Storage:** Saves text, chat, API keys, settings, and custom prompts in your browser. No data is sent to external servers (except for API calls to the chosen AI provider).
- **Appearance:** Light/dark mode, wide mode.
- **Settings Import/Export:** JSON format.

## 游닀 Usage Examples

4. **Compare:** Click "Compare" to see differences (Levenshtein, percentage, visual diffs).
5. **Switch:** Swap source and target text.
6. **Transcribe:** Select language, upload audio, click "Start Transcribe."
7. **Render Markdown:** Choose math renderer (KaTeX/MathJax), click "Render," use Ctrl+P to save.
8. **Translate .DOCX:** Select language, upload .docx, click "Start Translation."
